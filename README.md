Automated Report Generation is the process of programmatically collecting data, analyzing it, and producing structured reports without manual intervention. This technique is widely used in industries like business intelligence, finance, healthcare, and IT to streamline operations and ensure timely insights.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
At its core, automated report generation involves three key steps:

Data Collection: Data is gathered from various sources such as APIs, databases, spreadsheets, or logs. This can be scheduled at regular intervals or triggered by specific events.

Data Processing: The collected data is cleaned, formatted, and analyzed. Depending on the report type, this may include generating summaries, statistics, visualizations (charts/graphs), or detecting trends and anomalies.

Report Creation: The processed data is compiled into a well-structured documentâ€”usually in formats like PDF, Excel, HTML, or even interactive dashboards. Tools like Python (with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, Jinja2, and ReportLab) are often used for this purpose.
